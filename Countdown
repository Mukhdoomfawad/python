## Exercise 6: Countdown
# Write a program that takes a number as input and counts down to 0 using a while loop.
n = int(input("Enter number to count down from: "))
while n >= 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1

# Write a program that takes a number as input and counts down to 0 using a for loop.
n = int(input("Enter number to count down from: "))
for i in range(n,-1,-1):
    print(i)
